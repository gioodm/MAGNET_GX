# MAGNET_GX

R script that imports a transcriptomics dataset (https://www.med.upenn.edu/magnet/) and exports an annotated data file that is 
suitable for downstream biological analysis, such as pathway and network analysis.\
The dataset is an RNA-sequencing dataset from the MAGNet consortium. To generate this dataset, left ventricular free-wall 
tissue was harvested at the time of cardiac surgery from subjects with heart failure undergoing transplantation and 
from unused donor hearts with apparently normal function. This dataset is a spectacular resource of left ventricular transcriptomes 
of non-failing healthy donors, Peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM), Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) 
patients. Next to the RNA-sequencing data (in log2-transformed CPM values), limited sample information is available 
(age, sex, ethnicity, disease state).
